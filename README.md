// Ruben Pulido, 11/ 25/ 2025. I made a blackjack card game, in the code a dealer shows the name of the cards in the blackjack card game and the dealer reveals the number of cards 
// The rules of the Blackjack game is to get your hand total as close to nine of club, three of spade (12) as possible without going game over, or losing. The game deals with two cards to the player and two to the dealer, allows the player to hit or stand, and then the dealer draws until reaching at least 12.
// Linked list is being used to store the deck, drawing a card removes from the front of the LinkedList is also used, laslty, player and dealer hands are used as LinkedList.
// To play the card game, it is text-based, requiring you to press the return button on keyboard to continue playing. The card game displays dealer shows: name of the card, your hand:, and the number of cards you need to reach without losing.
